    Contexts are a way of organizing events. Every event belongs to a single
    context. While there is a catch-all context for events called 'Zalanthas',
    it is recommended that you create a context for your character. For example,
    if your character is called Amos and has the short description 'the tall,
    muscular man', you could create a context 'Amos (the tall, muscular man)'.
    That would allow you to easily search for events for that character if you
    use the Time Helper over multiple characters, and may be useful for future
    features.

    The default context is the context that will automatically be selected for
    new events. This can be changed in the Contexts tab.
